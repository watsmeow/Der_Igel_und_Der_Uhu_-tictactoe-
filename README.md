# Der_Igel_und_Der_Uhu_-tictactoe-
Yep! It's the time tested, age old project of TicTacToe. The theming is inspired by my best friend, who hails from Germany (as does my family). She has an intense love for hedgehogs, and I find the fact that "owl" in German is "Uhu" (the sound an owl makes). Therefore, the "players" are a hedgehog and an owl, and the overall visual theme is reminiscent of a German fairytale.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This project uses OOP to somewhat streamline what could be a relatively straightforward, but ugly mass of logic. 

## Lessons Learned:

Had to fiddle around with setTimeouts in order to get pieces and winner notifications to appear in the correct order, so it was a good lesson in the dreaded event loop.
